# rust-practice-shiz
## yer man learning rust lang!
This repo contains .rs files and executables from my journey to learn this extremely popular programming chad called Rust. 
This repo should help me as a guide for when I take on more complex projects that will use rust in the future.
While I work on this repo I will learn and understand Rust as well as version control/git.
This repo might contain basic-intermediate level projects.
Also, I plan to implement solutions in Rust for problem sets in Harvard's CS50 that were originally designed for C.
